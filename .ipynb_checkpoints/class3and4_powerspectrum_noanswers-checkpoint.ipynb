    "In the radiation dominated era, once perturbations enter the horizon, growth basically ceases until matter-radiation.  As the horizon gets larger with time, fluctuations on bigger and bigger scales enter the horizon and cease to grow (the DM perturbations actually grow logarithmically). Fluctuations on scales larger than the horizon, however, can continue to grow (we have not justified this here, and we will not go into these details). This process continues until radiation-matter equality. After $z_{eq}$, the growth of fluctations picks up again. For large enough scales, fluctuations never entered the horizon and thus never halted their growth\n",

This arises because modes with small wavelengths enter the Hubble radius early on and have to wait till the universe becomes matter dominated in order to grow in amplitude. This is in contrast to modes with large wavelengths which continue to grow. "
